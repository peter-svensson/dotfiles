# Apple has set in `/etc/zprofile` the execution of `path_helper` tool, which
# disorder the `PATH` variable like set here, prepending always system
# directories and causing some problems. Fix the following option avoid load ZSH
# startup files which follows the current one in the ZSH startup flow. In particular,
# `/etc/zprofile`, so disable run of `path_helper`. More info here
# https://gist.github.com/Linerre/f11ad4a6a934dcf01ee8415c9457e7b2, where I
# even propose this solution
